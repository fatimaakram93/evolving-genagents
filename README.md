# evolving-genagents
This project evolves AI agent personalities for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma using a Genetic Algorithm combined with LLM-based mutations.  Agents are built using genagents, and their behavior adapts over generations based on performance in simulated IPD matches. Mutations are driven by GPT-4o, modifying agents' personality traits through prompt-based reasoning.

# Key Features:
- Uses Axelrod for IPD tournaments
- Mutation via LLM prompt edits to agent memory
- Tracks fitness as average score per match
